# Research: Audio Filename Format 
## Decision 1: Delivery strategy for User Story 1  - Decision: Implement User Story 1 (Generate Deterministic Human-Readable Audio Filenames) as an independently testable vertical slice with explicit contracts. - Rationale: Preserves incremental delivery, rollback safety, and clear acceptance validation. - Alternatives considered:   - Bundle with other stories in one release (rejected: weaker traceability and harder defect isolation for Generate Deterministic Human-Readable Audio Filenames). 
## Decision 2: Delivery strategy for User Story 2  - Decision: Implement User Story 2 (Produce Valid Slug from Spoken Text) as an independently testable vertical slice with explicit contracts. - Rationale: Preserves incremental delivery, rollback safety, and clear acceptance validation. - Alternatives considered:   - Bundle with other stories in one release (rejected: weaker traceability and harder defect isolation for Produce Valid Slug from Spoken Text). 
## Decision 3: Delivery strategy for User Story 3  - Decision: Implement User Story 3 (Preserve Uniqueness Across Languages and Formats) as an independently testable vertical slice with explicit contracts. - Rationale: Preserves incremental delivery, rollback safety, and clear acceptance validation. - Alternatives considered:   - Bundle with other stories in one release (rejected: weaker traceability and harder defect isolation for Preserve Uniqueness Across Languages and Formats). 
## Decision 4: Integration and dependency failure handling  - Decision: Apply deterministic validation and failure mapping for all external boundaries in audio-filename-format workflows. - Rationale: Prevents partial undefined states and improves supportability under degraded dependencies. - Alternatives considered:   - Best-effort ad hoc error handling (rejected: non-repeatable operational behavior). 
## Decision 5: Observability and NFR verification  - Decision: Require explicit test evidence for performance, security, and diagnostics for each story phase. - Rationale: Converts non-functional objectives into release gates rather than post-hoc checks. - Alternatives considered:   - Defer NFR checks to final polish only (rejected: late discovery risk).
